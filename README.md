# Bulk Transcriptomic Analyses
This repository is intended for reproducing bulk transcriptomic analyses contained in the manuscript **"ACLY inhibition enhances tumor immunogenicity and resolves MASH-driven HCC"**. Manuscript figures corresponding to the results generated from each script are listed at the top of each script.

For analyses of mouse-derived RNA-Seq data, the scripts intake featureCounts matrix available from **GSE296668**. For analyses of human-derived microarray data, the script intakes a matrix of RMA normalized values avaialble from **GSE164760**. Additional associated files that are not present in the GEO repository are accesible here.
