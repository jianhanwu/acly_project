# Bulk Transcriptomic Analyses
This repository is intended for reproducing bulk transcriptomic analyses contained in the manuscript "ACLY inhibition enhances tumor immunogenicity and resolves MASH-driven HCC". At the top of each script are descriptions of the manuscript figures corresponding to the results generated therein.

For analyses of mouse-derived RNA-Seq data, the scripts intake featureCounts matrix available from GSE296668. For analyses of human-derived microarray data, the script intakes a matrix of RMA normalized values avaialble from GSE164760. Additional associated files that are not present in the GEO repository are accesible here.
