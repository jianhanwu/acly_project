# Transcriptomic analyses of ACLY expression in experimental and huamn-derived MASH-HCC liver tissue
This repository is intended for reproducing transcriptomic analyses contained in the manuscript **"ACLY inhibition enhances tumor immunogenicity and resolves MASH-driven HCC"**. Manuscript figures corresponding to the results generated from each script are listed at the top of each script.

Analysis of mouse-derived RNA-Seq data intakes featureCounts files available from **GSE296668**. Analysis of human-derived microarray data intakes CEL files avaialble from **GSE164760**. Analysis of human-derived snRNA-seq data intakes seurat object from **GSE189175**.

Additional requisite files can be found in the **Misc** folder.
