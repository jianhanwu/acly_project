# Bulk Transcriptomics
This repository is intended for reproducing bulk transcriptomic analyses contained in the manuscript "ACLY inhibition enhances tumor immunogenicity and resolves MASH-driven HCC". 

For analyses of mouse-derived RNA-Seq data, the scripts intake featureCounts matrix available from GSE296668. For analyses of human-derived microarray data, the script intakes a matrix of RMA normalized values avaialble from GSE164760.
